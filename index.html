            Ankit Rajpal is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science, 
			University of Delhi since November 2020. He has recently been awarded a patent 
			on a video watermarking tool developed for MPEG-4 AVC videos. He has done his 
			Ph.D. in the area of Image and Video Watermarking from the Department of 
			Computer Science, University of Delhi. His research interests include 
			image & video watermarking, machine learning, and Data Mining. He has published
			three papers in reputed International journals in addition to six papers in 
			conference proceedings. In the year 2017, he was awarded a travel grant by the 
			Department of Science and Technology (DST) for presenting his work in International 
			Joint Conference on Neural Networks. He obtained his B.Sc. Honours and 
			M.Sc. degrees in Computer Science from the University of Delhi securing the 
			second position in B.Sc. and fourth position in M.Sc. He possesses around 11 
			years of teaching experience at the Undergraduate level at Deen Dayal Upadhayaya 
			College (DDUC), University of Delhi (2011-20) and Royal Thimphu College, Thimphu, 
			Bhutan (2009-2011). He has been actively involved in the design of curriculum and 
			implementation guidelines for the teachers.

			Ankit Rajpal constantly works towards improvement in his teaching skills. 
			He has successfully completed various faculty development programs and MOOCs. 
			He has been associated with the conduct of various workshops for computer science 
			teachers in schools. Apart from this, he has been actively involved in organizing 
			various workshops for students and teachers at DDUC. He has also served as a faculty 
			advisor of DDUC Codechef Chapter (2016-2020). His academic involvements do not prevent
			him from taking up administrative responsibilities at his place of work. 
			Amongst other responsibilities, he has been actively associated with admissions
