          Ankit Rajpal is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science,
          University of Delhi since November 2020. He has recently been awarded a <span
            class="tint-color"><strong>patent
              on a video watermarking tool</strong></span> developed for MPEG-4 AVC videos. He has done his
          Ph.D. in the area of Image and Video Watermarking from the Department of
          Computer Science, University of Delhi. His research interests include
          image & video watermarking, machine learning, and Data Mining. He has published
          3 papers in reputed International journals in addition to <span class="tint-color"><strong>6
              papers</strong></span> in
          conference proceedings. In the year 2017, he was awarded a travel grant by the
          Department of Science and Technology (DST) for presenting his work in <span
            class="tint-color"><strong>International
              Joint Conference on Neural Networks</strong></span>.
          <br /><br />
          He obtained his M.Sc. and B.Sc. Honours degrees in Computer Science from the University of Delhi securing the
          second position in B.Sc. and fourth position in M.Sc. He possesses around 11
          years of teaching experience at the Undergraduate level at Deen Dayal Upadhayaya
          College (DDUC), University of Delhi (2011-20) and Royal Thimphu College, Thimphu,
          Bhutan (2009-2011). He has been actively involved in the design of curriculum and
          implementation guidelines for the teachers.
        </p><br />
        <p class="justify content">
          Ankit Rajpal constantly works towards improvement in his teaching skills.
          He has successfully completed various faculty development programs and MOOCs.
          He has been associated with the conduct of various workshops for computer science
          teachers in schools. Apart from this, he has been actively involved in organizing
          various workshops for students and teachers at DDUC. He has also served as a faculty
          advisor of DDUC Codechef Chapter (2016-2020). His academic involvements do not prevent
          him from taking up administrative responsibilities at his place of work.
          Amongst other responsibilities, he has been actively associated with admissions
          and design of prospectus for the students.
